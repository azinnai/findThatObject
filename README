Project 9: Find that object

THe dataset consists of two txt file:
	globe.txt contains the [x y z] points of a world globe object
	globeScene.txt contains the [x y z] points of a scene containing the object

Expected output:
Position of the object in the scene

p.s. I will generate other(even simpler) datasets in the next days
